The Referee should use these examples as guidance and inspiration for creating their monsters.

\vfill

\statpar{Brain Lord}
STR~14, DEX~14, WIL~20, 18hp, \mbox{immune} to mind control magic.

Its psychic ability allows it to levitate, project itself to other realities, and telepathically issue any command. If the target refuses to obey the command, they must succeed on a \save{WIL} or lose d8~WIL.

\subparagraph{Mind Blast:} attacks the target's mind with psychic energy for d8 Damage. Critical Damage affects WIL instead of STR and is avoided by a \save{WIL}.

\subparagraph{Critical Damage in Melee:} the target has its brain extracted and eaten. The Brain Lord absorbs its recent memories.

\vfill

\dimage{filtheater2}{120pt}

\statpar{Filth Eater}
STR~16, DEX~6, WIL~5, 16hp, Armour~1, d6~Bite.

Big, stupid beasts that eat nearly anything they find. Much prefer dead food to alive. Can bark out a very limited vocabulary of common tongue but have little comprehension.

\subparagraph{Critical Damage:} the target contracts filth fever unless they pass a \save{STR}. If they fail, then for the next day they are violently ill and do not benefit from Resting.

\vfill

\statpar{Gazer}
STR~16, DEX~16, WIL~17, 20hp, Armour~1.

Actively seeks to destroy any other lifeforms. Magic does not work within the Gazer's sight. May fire two of the following beams at different targets each turn.

\subparagraph{Telekinesis Beam:} up to an elephant-sized target is lifted, moved, or thrown. Living targets thrown this way take d6 Damage, but thrown objects may cause up to d12, depending on the size.

\subparagraph{Terror Beam:} \save{WIL} or be terrified. If you do anything on your next turn other than freeze or flee, you lose d6~WIL.

\subparagraph{Disintegration Beam:} d6 Damage ignoring \mbox{Armour}. Anyone taking Critical Damage is turned to dust. Will completely destroy static objects up to the size of an elephant.

\vfill

\statpar{Gelatinous Cube}
STR~14, DEX~3, WIL~3, 16hp, Armour~2.

Appears as hazy, wet air until the observer is dangerously close to the Cube. A chemical smell may betray its nature from further away. The Cube is attracted to noise and heat.

Does not perform normal attacks. Anyone that the Cube moves over is engulfed unless they pass a \save{DEX} to jump aside, assuming there is room to. Those engulfed lose d8~DEX each turn and d6~STR every hour as they are digested. They cannot free themselves but must be pulled from the Cube by other means. When the Cube takes Critical Damage, it collapses into a puddle of sticky ooze.

\vfill

\statpar{Ghoul}
STR 13, DEX 15, WIL 6, 5hp, 2d6 Claws, d8 Bite, \mbox{immune} to mind control magic.

Monstrous denizens of forlorn cemeteries feed on human flesh, be it dead or alive.

\subparagraph{Ghoul Touch:} if the claws reduce STR score, \mbox{the target} is Stunned until passing a \save{STR} at the end of their turn, exuding stench that makes those nearby sickened.

\vfill

\statpar{Gnoll}
STR~12, DEX~12, WIL~7, 9hp, Armour~2 (light + shield), axe (d6), 3d6s in stolen coins and trinkets.

Their stink is highly recognisable and spreads throughout their surroundings. 1-in-6 chance of being non-hostile. Can be bargained with but are only really interested in meat, preferably alive.

\break

\statpar{Goblin}
STR~8, DEX~14, WIL~8, 4hp, spear (d6), bow (d4).

Mischievous creatures that can easily be bribed with items that they consider pretty. Some of them can cast Cantrips.

\vfill

\statpar{Hellhound}
DEX~12, 5hp, Armour~1, d6~Bite, \mbox{immune} to Fire.

Black fiery demonic dogs that hunt in packs.

\subparagraph{Fire Breath:} d4 Fire Damage in a small cone.

\vfill

\statpar{Hook Horror}
STR~15, DEX~8, WIL~6, 7hp, Armour~3, 2d8~Hooks.

A ten-foot tall Horror stalks tunnels and caves, using its audible clicking as a form of echolocation. Its vision is very poor, and it is easily disoriented by loud noises.

Anything dog-sized or smaller is potential food to be swallowed whole when dealt Critical Damage, causing d6~STR Loss each turn after swallowing. It will treat anything larger than this as a threat to its territory and fight fiercely but will avoid anything larger than itself.

\vfill

\statpar{Hootbear}
STR~15, DEX~6, WIL~5, 10hp, Armour~1, 2d8~Claws, Hoot.

Constantly gives out subsonic hooting, used to sense its surroundings. Thus you can never sneak up on one unless its hearing is somehow impaired.

\subparagraph{Hoot:} once per Rest, it can give out a single, boneshaking hoot that causes d6 Damage to everyone nearby. Anyone reduced to 0hp by this hoot is not at risk of a Critical Damage but must pass a \save{STR} or be Stunned for the next turn.

\vfill

\statpar{Imp}
STR~6, DEX~16, WIL~14, 3hp, d6~Venomous Bite, \mbox{non-magical} attacks are Impaired.

A small winged demon-trickster. Can use its action to cast Detect Magic and Invisibility at will, and Suggestion once per Rest.

\subparagraph{Venomous Bite:} if the bite reduces STR score, \mbox{the target} suffers 1 DEX Loss as well.

\subparagraph{Shape-shift:} changes appearance to a small beast.

\break

\statpar{Landshark}
STR~17, DEX~8, WIL~8, 18hp, Armour~3, d8~Bite.

Carves through earth as if it were water, using this to lay in ambush for prey. If it fears for its life, a Landshark may cause a cave-in. Falling rocks will cause d6 Damage but anyone that stays long enough to be buried takes d10 Damage. The Landshark will have burrowed away before this point.

\vfill

\statpar{Manticore}
STR~17, DEX~15, 8hp, Armour~1, 2d6~Claws, d8~Bite.

A horrible abomination with a body of a lion, a toothy human-like head, and a tail full of spikes.

\subparagraph{Tail Spikes:} venomous spikes could be shoot quite far, dealing d6~Damage. If the spike reduces STR score, the target suffers d4 DEX Loss as well.

\vfill

\statpar{Mummy}
STR~16, DEX~8, 9hp, Armour~1, d8~Fist, \mbox{immune} to non-magical attacks and mind control magic, Fire attacks are Enhanced.

Vengeful embalmed corpses awoken by careless tomb robbers in ruins of ancient cities or temples.

All who are surprised by a Mummy must succeed on a \save{WIL} or be Stunned for the next turn.

\subparagraph{Critical Damage:} infects the target with {\em mummy rot}. The target loses d4~STR and maximum HP right away and each following day until cured by removing the curse or a week of conventional healing.

\vfill

\statpar{Ogre}

\statpar{Orc}
STR~11, DEX~9, WIL~8, 5hp, Armour~2 (piecemeal armour + shield), martial weapon (d6/d8).

\vfill

\statpar{Phase Panther}
STR~16, DEX~18, WIL~6, 13hp, 2d8~Clawed~Tentacles.

The beast's displaced image grants it Advantage on Critical Damage Saves. Will attack any other living things for fun without provocation.

\break

\vfill
\dimage{purpleworm}{234pt}

\statpar{Purple Worm}
STR~20, DEX~3, WIL~5, 30hp, Armour~3, d10~Sting.

Giant worm that moves underground leaving \mbox{circular} tunnels in its wake.

\subparagraph {Swallow:} a medium or smaller creature must pass a \save{DEX} or be swallowed whole, losing d10~DEX each turn and d8~STR every hour as they are digested. When rolling against Critical Damage, the Worm must succeed on an additional \save{STR} or regurgitate all swallowed creatures.

\subparagraph{Critical Damage:} the target is stung, losing 3d6~STR.

\vfill

\statpar{Red Dragon}
STR~20, WIL~12, 25hp, Armour~3, 2d10~Claws, \mbox{Advantage} on Saves from magic, flight.

Cunning and dangerous winged reptile of enormous size. Can speak but generally chooses not to unless properly motivated.

\subparagraph{Fire Breath:} d6 Fire Damage to everyone within the blast. Also causes d6 Fire Damage at the end of their next turn until a \save{DEX} is passed or any other way to put out the flames is found.

Red Dragons instinctively hoard treasure, particularly gold items. A dragon's hoard will be worth 5d20g. If properly harvested, dead dragon's parts will be worth 100g to specialist buyers.

\vfill
\break

\vfill

\statpar{Rust Monster}
DEX~12, WIL~5, 6hp, d6~Bite.

Does not normally attack. Able to turn metal into rust-like dust, which it then consumes. If a melee opponent is carrying a metal weapon, shield, or armour, the Rust Monster will turn one of these to rust as an action, unless they pass a \save{DEX}.

\vfill

\statpar{Skeleton}
DEX~13, WIL~12, 5hp, Armour~2 (only against piercing attacks such as arrows and spears), blunt sword (d6), \mbox{immune} to mind control magic.

When a skeleton would be killed by physical attacks, it is smashed into at least two separate pieces. Unless they are kept apart, these will reform on the skeleton's next turn, remaining at 0hp. Each half will continue to fight, but the half without a sword causes only d4 Damage.

\vfill

\dimage{snakedemon}{250pt}

\vspace{-2ex}

\statpar{Snake Demon}

\vfill
\break

\subparagraph{Soaring Flight:} the caster can fly quite swiftly until they touch the ground or take Damage.

DEX~13, WIL~7, 6hp, Armour~1, spear (d8).

\subparagraph{Mutations:} due to their unnatural regeneration, some Trolls grow extra limbs, heads or develop even weirder deformities.

Giant abominable apes that usually dwell in far mountain forests and prefer to hunt from ambush.
