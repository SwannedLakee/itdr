\index{Spells}
\index{Tome}
Written in Runic and found in Tomes and Scrolls, \textbf{Spells} require a few minutes of uninterrupted calm and attention to cast, as well as requiring a set of detailed gestures and incantations. Consequently, Spells are generally impossible to cast in combat.

Mystics can cast any Spell of a Circle \textbf{equal or lower} to their Mystic Level.

\index{Focus}
\paragraph{Focus}
Every Mystic carries a Focus, typically an orb, wand, or staff that allows to instantly cast a Prepared Spell or any Cantrip you know as an \textbf{action} while performing the proper gestures and incantations. It does not work when wearing \textbf{armour}, \mbox{except} for Cantrips.

\index{Spells!prepared}
\index{Prepared Spells|see {Spells, prepared}}
\index{Spellburn}
\paragraph{Prepared Spells and Spellburn}
During the Rest, you can use your Tome to prepare a~number of Spells equal to your Experience Level to cast using your Focus as an action.

Casting a Prepared Spell as an action causes \mbox{\textbf{Spellburn}} \mbox{Damage} \textbf{to the caster} equal to \textbf{2hp per Spell Circle ignoring Armour}. At 0hp, Spellburn targets WIL \mbox{instead} of STR: pass a \save{WIL} to avoid Critical Spellburn or be Stunned for the next turn.

\vspace{-0.5ex}
\begin{dbox}
	Optionally, this also causes a \textbf{Magic Mishap}\footnotemark[1].
\end{dbox}
\vspace{-0.5ex}

\footnotetext[1]{See \textbf{\safenameref{sec:magic_mishaps}[Magic Mishaps]} in \textbf{\customref{ch:appendix_a}{Appendix A}}.}

\index{Spells!signature}
\index{Signature Spells|see {Spells, signature}}
\paragraph{Signature Spells}
Each time you take Mystic Feature, choose an additional Spell to cast without preparation and at half its cost (\textbf{1hp per Spell Circle ignoring Armour}).

\index{Scroll Activation}
\paragraph{Scroll Activation}
If needed, Mystics can activate a Scroll as an action. The Spell is cast as \textbf{Signature}, destroying the Scroll.

\vspace{-0.5ex}
\begin{dbox}
	\paragraph{Amateur Scroll Activation (optional)}
	If the Circle is \textbf{lower} than their Level, non-mystics can succeed on a \save{WIL} to cast the Spell as \mbox{\textbf{Prepared}}, or botch it, suffering a \textbf{Magic Mishap}\footnotemark[1] \mbox{instead.} The Scroll is destroyed in either case.
\end{dbox}
\vspace{-0.5ex}

\index{Spells!ongoing effects}
\subparagraph{Ongoing Effects} of any Spell last while you are conscious, or until you cast a new Spell, but summoned extraplanar beings remain. When taking Damage, succeed on a \save{WIL} to maintain the Spell.

\index{Spells!persistent}
\index{Persistent Spells|see {Spells, persistent}}
\subparagraph{Persistent Spells} have their effects last as long as you wish or until you cast the same Spell again. You can sustain up to \textbf{2~$\times$~Mystic Level} simultaneously.

\enlargethispage{1ex}
\break

\index{Spells!cantrips}
\index{Cantrips|see {Spells, cantrips}}
\subparagraph{Cantrips} are minor tricks and not true Spells, do not interrupt ongoing effects of the previous Spell, and require you to use your \textbf{Focus} to cast them.

\subparagraph{Scrolls} of new Spells found by Mystics are usually attached to the Tome for the convenience of usage.

\index{Spells!dispel}
\index{Dispel|see {Spells, dispel}}
\paragraph{Dispel}
The Focus can be used to \textbf{dispel} the ongoing effect of another Mystic's Spell unless they pass a \save{WIL}. If their Mystic Level is higher than yours, they get an Advantage.

Dispelling a Persistent Spell requires \textbf{you} to make a \save{WIL} instead. On fail the Spell stays, and you suffer WIL~Loss based on the Spell Circle: from d2 (Cantrip) to d12 (\nth{5} Circle). If your Mystic Level is higher than the Spell Circle, you have an Advantage.
