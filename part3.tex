\section{Size Score and Populace}
\index{Size Score}
\index{SIZ|see {Size Score}}
\index{Populace}

Size Score, or SIZ, is a measure of the populace of your Domain and may reach a maximum of 20.

\begin{dtable}[Lr|Lr|Lr]
	\textbf{SIZ} & \textbf{Populace} & \textbf{SIZ} & \textbf{Populace} & \textbf{SIZ} & \textbf{Populace}\\
	0  & <100   & 7	& 7,500		& 14 & 100,000 \\
	1  & 100	& 8	& 10,000	& 15 & 150,000 \\
	2  & 300	& 9	& 15,000	& 16 & 200,000 \\
	3  & 600	& 10& 20,000	& 17 & 300,000 \\
	4  & 1,000	& 11& 30,000	& 18 & 500,000 \\
	5  & 3,000	& 12& 50,000	& 19 & 750,000 \\
	6  & 5,000	& 13& 75,000	& 20 & 1,000,000 \\
\end{dtable}

\index{Domain Focus}
At the \textbf{start} of each month, choose Domain Focus --- this goal is achieved at the \textbf{end} of the month:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Funding:} You spend 1s for each of your populace this month. Choose an extra Domain Focus. You do not need to roll for Unrest this month.
	\item \textbf{Taxation:} You gather extra money this month, gaining 1s for each of your populace.
	\item \textbf{Growth:} Roll d20. If this is higher than your SIZ, then your SIZ is increased by 1.
	\item \textbf{Conscription:} Recruit an army (see \textbf{Training Soldiers}). SIZ is decreased by one, and you cannot repeat Conscription until it increases again. Next Growth roll will have Disadvantage.
	\item \textbf{Prosperity:} You do not need to roll to see if there is Unrest in your Domain this month.
\end{itemize}

\index{Unrest}
\subparagraph{Unrest:} At the \textbf{end} of the month, roll d20. If this is lower than your SIZ, there is Unrest in your Domain. 10\% of populace revolts and can seize control of your Domain unless quashed. SIZ is decreased by one.

\index{Large Groups}

\index{Soldiers}
\subparagraph{Training Soldiers:} 20\% of populace are fit for calling into service as poorly skilled conscripts (3hp). A further 1\% of your populace are professional soldiers (STR~12, 5hp, Novice Warrior). All troops must be equipped as required.

An army that won a battle against an equal or stronger opponent can be trained further at the rate of 1\% of your populace per month.

Conscripts become soldiers (1s/person), and \mbox{soldiers} become champions (10s/person) (STR~14, 10hp, Proven Warrior).

\subparagraph{Large Battles:} When handling large numbers of combatants (usually 10 or more), they should be massed together as a unit. Units have the same Hit Points as a single combatant, but add 1 Damage for as many times to one they outnumber their opponents (or subtract if outnumbered), from --5 to +5. E.g., a unit of 200 cavemen fighting 50 spearmen outnumber them \mbox{4-to-1}, gaining 4 bonus Damage.

When units fail a \textbf{\save{Critical Damage}}, their numbers are halved, and they must pass a \save{WIL} or break and disband. At STR~0 they are wiped out.\tight

Individual attacks against units are Impaired.

Unit attacks against individuals are Enhanced, add +5 bonus Damage, and cause Blast Damage.

Unit attacks that cause Blast Damage against units have bonus weapon Damage die.

\index{Sieges}
\index{Walls}
\index{Structures}
\subparagraph{Sieges:} Wooden walls have 6hp, Armour~6, and stone walls have 8hp, Armour~8. Reducing a wall to 0hp allows passage over it. Walls and other defensive structures usually ignore Damage from anything but siege engines and such.

\index{Siege Engines}
\subparagraph{Siege Engines} cause d12 Blast Damage.
